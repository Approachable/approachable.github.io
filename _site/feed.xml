&lt;h2 id=&quot;typography-elements-in-one&quot;&gt;Typography Elements in One&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a informative paragraph. &lt;strong&gt;This text is bolded.&lt;/strong&gt; But not this one! &lt;em&gt;How about italic text?&lt;/em&gt; Cool right? Ok, let’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;combine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; them together. Yeah, that’s right! I have code to highlight, so &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ThisIsMyCode()&lt;/code&gt;. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;here we go&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.example.com&quot;&gt;http://www.example.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;headings-h1-to-h6&quot;&gt;Headings H1 to H6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;h1-heading&quot;&gt;H1 Heading&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;h2-heading&quot;&gt;H2 Heading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;h3-heading&quot;&gt;H3 Heading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;h4-heading&quot;&gt;H4 Heading&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;h5-heading&quot;&gt;H5 Heading&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;h6-heading&quot;&gt;H6 Heading&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;Footnote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. You can even add more footnotes, with link! &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;Blockquote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Start by doing what’s necessary; then do what’s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. –Francis of Assisi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This theme does NOT support nested blockquotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;list-items&quot;&gt;List Items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First order list item&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unordered list can use asterisks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or minuses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or pluses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-blocks&quot;&gt;Code Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;JavaScript syntax highlighting&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;alert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Python syntax highlighting&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;run_some_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Docs...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot; data-lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;/* css synthax highlighting */&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;#container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;margin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;-240px&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;100%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;tag&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;table&quot;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;table-1-with-alignment&quot;&gt;Table 1: With Alignment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Tables&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;Are&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;Cool&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;col 3 is&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;right-aligned&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$1600&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;col 2 is&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;centered&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$12&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;zebra stripes&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;are neat&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;$1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;table-2-with-typography-elements&quot;&gt;Table 2: With Typography Elements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Markdown&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Less&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Pretty&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;renders&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nicely&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;horizontal-line&quot;&gt;Horizontal Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HTML &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element is for creating a “thematic break” between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;hr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;___&lt;/code&gt;: three consecutive underscores&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;: three consecutive dashes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;***&lt;/code&gt;: three consecutive asterisks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;renders to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;media&quot;&gt;Media&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;youtube-embedded-iframe&quot;&gt;YouTube Embedded Iframe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;420&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nN6QuNqmAwk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;image&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSn8cwf82ee9tfml4Wx-tsM5AUavJ_DRHIiXXE4RejRp0RF2L7f6g&quot; alt=&quot;Nature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Footnote number one yeah baby! &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;A footnote you can link to - &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;click here!&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:2&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;
